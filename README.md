# Find my Dorm 
Navigate Your Next Home at UIUC

## Motivation

Before enrolling at UIUC, upperclassmen recommended choosing housing from specific property management companies. However, the existing rental apps primarily cover nearby houses rather than apartments. To address this inconvenience, we decided to collect a dataset consolidating details of properties from prominent agencies near UIUC. This dataset allows users to explore and select desirable housing based on various criteria.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cleo1115/Find-my-Dorm_apartment-searcher.git
   cd Find-my-Dorm_apartment-searcher
   ```
   
2. **Run the :**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
3. **Explore the Dataset:**
   Input the requirements of apartments to explore the consolidated dataset and transportation visualizations.

## How to Use in Python Code
1. **Example: Search for apartments with more than 2 bathrooms:**
```python
All_apt[All_apt['Bathroom'] > 2]
```

## Project Hypotheses, Conclusions and Findings

### Hypotheses:

1. **Apartment Features and Pricing:**
   - *Scenario:* Different property management companies offer apartments with varying features and pricing structures.
   - *Hypothesis:* Apartments managed by the same company are likely to share similarities in features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms) and exhibit pricing trends.
   - *Conclusion:* The project's findings align with the hypothesis, confirming that apartments managed by the same company indeed share similarities in features and pricing trends. This insight provides valuable information for students looking for specific features or expecting consistent pricing from a particular property management company.

2. **Budget-Friendly Options:**
   - *Scenario:* Students often have budget constraints and seek affordable housing options.
   - *Hypothesis:* There is a correlation between the number of bedrooms and the rent, allowing the identification of budget-friendly options based on bedroom count.
   - *Conclusion:* The correlation between the number of bedrooms and rent supports the hypothesis, enabling students to identify budget-friendly options based on their desired bedroom count. This finding facilitates informed decision-making for those with financial constraints.

3. **Studio Apartment Demand:**
   - *Scenario:* Some students prefer the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of studio apartments.
   - *Hypothesis:* Studio apartments are in high demand and may have a different pricing trend compared to apartments with multiple bedrooms.
   - *Conclusion:* The limited availability of studio apartments supports the hypothesis of high demand for this housing type. Understanding this demand can guide property management companies in diversifying their offerings to meet student preferences.

### Key Findings:

1. **Apartment Exploration:**
   - Apartments with more than 2 bathrooms are available, providing options for those seeking additional bathroom amenities.
   - Apartments with rents under $1000 are accessible, offering affordable housing choices for budget-conscious individuals.
   - The availability of studio apartments is limited, suggesting a potential gap in meeting the demand for this housing type.

2. **Transportation Conditions:**
   - The transportation map provides a clear visualization of nearby bus stops, aiding users in assessing public transportation accessibility.
   - Bus stops near popular housing areas are well-distributed, contributing to convenient access for residents.

3. **Property Management Companies:**
   - Certain property management companies dominate the market, indicating their influence on the rental landscape.
   - Apartments managed by specific companies consistently exhibit certain features, allowing for informed expectations by prospective tenants.
